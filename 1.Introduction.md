## What is docker?

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create deploy and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libaries and other dependencies and ship it all out as one package.

  
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using **containers**. It packages an application's code and all its dependencies together in a standardized unit, ensuring the application runs consistently regardless of the environment it's deployed on.

Here's an analogy: Imagine you're a chef creating a dish. You gather all the ingredients (code, libraries, etc.) and put them in a recipe box (Docker image). This recipe box can be easily shared with other chefs (developers) and used to prepare the dish (application) in any kitchen (environment) without worrying about missing ingredients or variations in equipment.

**Benefits of using Docker:**

- **Simplified development and deployment:** Develop and test your application in a consistent environment across different machines.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale your application by running multiple instances of the same container.
- **Resource efficiency:** Containers use fewer resources compared to virtual machines, allowing you to run more applications on the same hardware.
- **Faster build and deploy times:** Standardised environments mean less time spent on configuration and troubleshooting
